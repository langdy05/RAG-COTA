\# Northern Cambodia Tourism Guide



\## Overview  

The northern region of Cambodia — covering provinces such as Kratié Province, Stung Treng Province, Ratanakiri Province, Mondulkiri Province, Preah Vihear Province and adjacent zones — offers a mixture of river‑based ecosystems, indigenous culture, remote heritage and dense nature. These places remain less visited compared with Cambodia’s major tourist hubs, yielding opportunities for deeper immersion, eco‑tourism and research‑oriented travel.

\- Accommodation: budget guest‑houses from ~ \*\*US $10‑20/night\*\*; mid‑range ~ \*\*US $30‑40/night\*\* depending on remoteness.  

\- Because distances, road‑conditions and transport vary, allocate extra time and transport‑budget for remote‑area trips.

\## Practical Tips \& Considerations  

\- Dry‑season (roughly November‑March) is preferred for easier access and better weather in these regions.  

\- In remote/nature zones: insect repellent, sun‑protection, comfortable walking shoes required.  

\- Lodging and amenities may be more basic than in major tourist hubs — plan accordingly.  

\- Respect local culture: in indigenous villages ask permission before photographing, dress modestly, engage respectfully.  

\- Transport: remote regions may involve dirt roads, river or boat‑access — allocate extra travel time and plan for return.  

\- As always, confirm latest safety/entry info, especially near border or remote areas.
